# Introduction

The mission of CreatorJS is to save time by automating the routine.

The routine is different for everyone. For me, it is:

Search for the place to insert a new component. Right-click. Create a new file.
Type in the component's name. Repeat a few times for styles, tests, and index files.
For each file use IDE snippets to generate the initial structure or write it from scratch.
Don't forget to use default export for the pages. Then redux. I don't remember it by heart, I have to copy and paste it.
That's approximately 6 files. I have to creat or update all of them by hand.
And then connect redux to the component. 

It is just one example of my routine. After doing it many times I feel like this:

For some tasks, you know in advance how things should work because they were done hundreds of times.
You know, what files to create or update, and how to connect them to each other.
If you find yourself in this situation, perhaps, it is time to automate the routine.
