# Introduction

The mission of CreatorJS is to save time by automating the routine.

The routine is different for everyone. For me, it is:

Search for the place to insert a new component. Right-click. Create a new file.
Type in the component's name. Repeat a few times for styles, tests, and, perhaps, index files.
For each file use snippets to generate the initial structure or write it from scratch.
Do you need redux? How many files are in redux? Imagine, creating or updating all of them by hand.
And then connecting redux to the component. This workflow can go further.

For some tasks, you know in advance how things should work because they were done hundreds of times.
You know, what files to create or update, and how to connect them to each other.
If you find yourself in this situation, perhaps, it is time to automate these tasks.
