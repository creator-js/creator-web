# Core Concepts

### How CreatorJS works?

- You define the questions that CreatorJS CLI will ask you.
- You define the templates of files that should be created or updated.
- Run the CLI and answer the questions. Your answers are passed to the templates.
- Files are created or updated from the templates enriched with your answers.
